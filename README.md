Carpark unknown is a project for Govhack 2018. 

This project aims to use the city of melbourne's parking sensor data to assist government and the general public with various issues surrounding carparks in the city.

The goal of this project is to:
* Show real time parking data for end users
* Show areas of high violation for use by local government
* Show areas of high outflow to give users a good idea where they are likely to find a car park
* Show areas of high inflow to highlight areas of high competition to avoid
